## Surf Forecaster


This is a WIP, it is meant to turn into a surf forecasting web application mimicking popular ones like Surfline, Surfreport etc...

Currently it displays real surf data for a single beach : São João da Caparica, Lisbon Portugal

It makes use of the open weather API by Open Meteo.
